# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Overview

1. When making changes that affect the public API or behavior, create a changeset.

   ```bash
   npm run changeset
   ```

1. Merging PRs with changesets prompts the CI to open a **Version Packages PR**.

1. Merging the Version Packages PR finalizes versioning and changelogs, including updating the version in `package.json`
