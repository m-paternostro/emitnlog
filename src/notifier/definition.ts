  /**
   * Returns a promise that resolves to the next event notified by this notifier.
   *
   * This method allows clients to await a single event without registering a persistent listener. It is especially
   * useful in scenarios where the client prefers a promise-based flow or only needs to observe the next occurrence of
   * an event.
   *
   * The returned promise:
   *
   * - Resolves with the next notified event
   * - Does not interfere with existing listeners. Moreover, the promise is resolved after the listeners are notified.
   * - Only rejects if the notifier is closed before a notified event - in this case the promise rejects with a
   *   `emitnlog/utils/ClosedError`.
   *
   * It is important to notice that the returned promise is tied to a single event: to wait for a subsequent event after
   * the returned promise is settled, call `waitForEvent()` again. Also, avoid caching the returned promise unless the
   * intent is to observe only the next event.
   *
   * @example Basic usage
   *
   * ```ts
   * import { createEventNotifier } from 'emitnlog/notifier';
   *
   * const notifier = createEventNotifier<string>();
   *
   * const event = await notifier.waitForEvent();
   * console.log(`Received event: ${event}`);
   * ```
   *
   * @example Using in a loop
   *
   * ```ts
   * import type { EventNotifier } from 'emitnlog/notifier';
   *
   * async function logNext5(notifier: EventNotifier<string>) {
   *   for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
   *     const value = await notifier.waitForEvent();
   *     console.log(`Received #${i + 1}:`, value);
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * @returns A promise that resolves to the next event.

  /**
   * Notifies all registered listeners with the provided event.

   * This method:
   *
   * - Calls all registered listeners with the event in their registration order
   * - Ignores errors thrown by listeners (they won't affect other listeners)
   * - Ignores returned promises (results are not awaited)
   * - Does nothing if there are no listeners and no pending waiters (created via `waitForEvent()`)
   * - If the event is a function, it will be called if there are listeners or a pending waiter, and its return value will
   *   be used as the event.
   * - When `T` is `void`, `notify()` can be called without arguments.

   * @example
   *
   * ```ts
