/**
 * Wraps and tracks methods of the given object using the provided tracker.
 *
 * This utility modifies the passed-in object directly, replacing method implementations with tracked versions. If
 * method names are not specified, all enumerable method names (including inherited ones, except from Object.prototype)
 * are tracked. Clients should consider reducing the amount of tracked method for objects with too many properties.
 *
 * Works with both class instances and plain objects. Supports any value with callable properties, including arrays and
 * built-in types â€” use with care if targeting unexpected inputs.
 *
 * By default the method of built-in objects (like Arrays, Maps, and Sets) are not tracked. Use the
 * `options.trackBuiltIn` to change this behavior, however these objects may behave unexpectedly in testing frameworks
 * or serialization tools after being tracked.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```ts
 * // Track all methods of a plain object
 * const calculator = { add: (a, b) => a + b, subtract: (a, b) => a - b };
 * trackMethods(tracker, calculator);
 * calculator.add(5, 3); // This invocation will be tracked
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```ts
 * // Track specific methods only
 * class UserService {
 *   createUser(name) {
 *     return { id: 1, name };
 *   }
 *   deleteUser(id) {
 *     return true;
 *   }
 *   getUsers() {
 *     return [];
 *   }
 * }
 * const service = new UserService();
 *
 * // Only createUser and deleteUser are tracked
 * trackMethods(tracker, service, { methods: ['createUser', 'deleteUser'] });
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```ts
 * // Track methods of built-in types
 * const mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
 * trackMethods(tracker, mySet, { methods: ['add', 'delete'], trackBuiltIn: true });
 * mySet.add(4); // This invocation is tracked
 * ```
 *
 * @param tracker - The tracker to use to track the methods.
 * @param target - The object to track the methods of.
 * @param options - The options to use to track the methods.
 * @returns A set of method names that were successfully wrapped.
